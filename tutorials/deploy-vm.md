# 1. Deploy Virtual Machine in Azure

In this section, you will learn how to set up a Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine with an Nginx webserver, which will be publicly accessible from the internet. This will allow you to host your own website or web application on Azure. By the end of this section, you will be able to:

* Use Azure Portal.
* Create and configure a Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machine on Azure.
* Install and run Nginx webserver on your virtual machine.
* Configure a domain name for your web server and access it from the Internet.



## 1.1 Prerequisites
